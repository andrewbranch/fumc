  <p>ACS calendars can be converted to iCalendar format via this web app for use with Google Calendar, Apple&rsquo;s Calendar.app, iPhone calendars, and many others. To subscribe to them, use the URLs provided below. Only published events are included. There is an extraordinary number of events on the ACS calendar, so at any given time you can only see events one year back and one year ahead. This specification is subject to change in the future.</p>

    <h4 class="ui header">Named Calendars</h4>
    <p>Any individual calendar, even ones that are added in the future, can be accessed by name. To do so, any spaces and special characters in the calendar name must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL encoded</a>, and then inserted into the URL <code>webcal://api.fumcpensacola.com/v3/ical/CALENDAR_NAME.ics</code>, where <code>CALENDAR_NAME</code> is the URL encoded calendar name. For example, the URL for the &ldquo;MCA &amp; Children's Ministry&rdquo; calendar would be</p>
    <div class="ui segment"><code>webcal://api.fumcpensacola.com/v3/ical/MCA%20%26%20Children's%20Minsitry.ics</code></div>
    <p>The calendar name is case-sensitive and must match exactly.</p>

    <h4 class="ui header">All Calendars Combined</h4>
    <p>You can alternatively subscribe to one calendar that combines published events from all calendars. Just replace the name of the calendar in the URL above with <code>all</code>.</p>
